# ES6 基本介绍


ES6 - ECMAScript 2015, June 2015

This update adds significant new syntax for writing complex applications, including classes and modules, but defines them semantically in the same terms as ECMAScript 5 strict mode. Other new features include iterators and for/of loops, Python-style generators and generator expressions, arrow functions, binary data, typed arrays, collections (maps, sets and weak maps), promises, number and math enhancements, reflection, and proxies (metaprogramming for virtual objects and wrappers). The complete list is extensive.

Browser support for ES2015 is still incomplete. However, ES2015 code can be transpiled into ES5 code, which has more consistent support across browsers. Transpiling adds an extra step to build processes whereas polyfills allow adding extra functionalities by including another JavaScript file.

ES7 - ECMAScript 2016, June 2016
New features include the exponentiation operator (**), Array.prototype.includes (not to be confused with ClassList.contains).

ES 8 - ECMAScript 2017, June 2017
Includes await/async, which works using generators and promises.

ES.Next
ES.Next is a dynamic name that refers to whatever the next version is at time of writing. ES.Next features are more correctly called proposals, because, by definition, the specification has not been finalized yet.


## ES6的作用

ES6的出现并没有改变javascript语言的特性,`原理还是不变的`.

ES6的作用是:
1. 简化了大部分写法
2. 减少代码出现低级bug的可能性
3. 提高开发效率, 将关注点更多的放在业务上,而非语言上.

ES6是对javascript的一个大版本的改进,相当于c++11对于c++98的意义. 后续虽然持续的有版本更新,但都是一些小功能的feature添加.

## 为什么使用ES6
webpack和babel等工具已经很成熟的解决了IE11以上的浏览器的ES6支持问题.
外部环境已经非常成熟,并且大部分公司都在使用.

一句话: 不想3-5年后失业,现在就开始用吧.
