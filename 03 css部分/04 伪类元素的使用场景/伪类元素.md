# 伪类元素的 z-index



# 不可以在伪类元素上绑定任何事件



This is not possible; pseudo-elements are not part of the DOM at all so you can't bind any events directly to them, you can only bind to their parent elements.

If you must have a click handler on the red region only, you have to make a child element, like a span, place it right after the opening <p> tag, apply styles to p span instead of p:before, and bind to it.
