# npx
npx is a tool for running npm packages that:
1. live inside of a local node_modules folder or
2. are not installed globally.

npx looks into the local /node_modules folder for the package and if it can’t find it, it will download and run it without having that package globally installed.
npx can reach into node_modules to run package binaries

npx is a replacement for installing global packages. It encourages you to install packages locally, but still be able run them as if they were global, just with npx.
