# canvas.captureStream
```js
var stream = canvas.captureStream(frameRate);
```
* 参数：frameRate （可选）
A double-precision floating-point value that indicates the rate of capture of each frame. If not set, a new frame will be captured each time the canvas changes; if set to 0, frames will not be captured automatically; instead, they will only be captured when the returned track's requestFrame() method is called.

* 返回： MediaStream 对象。
