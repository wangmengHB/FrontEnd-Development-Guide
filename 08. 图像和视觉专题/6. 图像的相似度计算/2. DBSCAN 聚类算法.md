# DBSACAN
DBSCAN is a density based clustering algorithm that works by successively growing a cluster from initial seed points. If the density in the circle proximity (which has the radius parameter Eps) of a point is above or equal a threshold level, denoted by the MinPts parameter, the cluster is expanded forward by assigning all the unassigned points in the neighborhood to it. The algorithm then recursively proceeds with the same steps for each of the newly added points to the cluster. Points that will not be assigned to any cluster by the end of this process are labeled as noise.

The current implementation supports only two dimensional data.
