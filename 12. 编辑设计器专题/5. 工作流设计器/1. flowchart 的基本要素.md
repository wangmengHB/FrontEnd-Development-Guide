# flowchart 的基本要素

* Process
Represents a process or step in the flowchart. 

* Decision
Indicates a point where the outcome of a decision dictates the next step. There can be multiple outcomes, but often there are just two - yes and no. 
Decision represents the choice made by the user from mutually exclusive options, e.g., a student choose among different lesson plans. 

* Terminal Points: ( Start, End, User)
Indicates the starting and ending points of a process. 

* Data Shape
Indicates that information is coming into the process from outside, or leaving the process.

* Delay shape
Represents a waiting period where no activity is done. In Process Mapping, delays are often important as they may result in adding to the cost of the product or simply delaying its production.

* Input/action symbol
Represents a user response that directs the course flow from that point onwards, i.e., an online test or questionnaire form.

* Off-page reference
Use a set of hyperlinks between two pages of a flowchart or between a sub-process shape and a separate flowchart page that shows the steps in that sub-process.

* Document
Represents a step that results in a document.
